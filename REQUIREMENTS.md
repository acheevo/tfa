# Fullstack Template - Foundation Requirements

This document defines the essential requirements for a production-ready SaaS foundation template. The goal is to provide the boring, essential infrastructure that every SaaS needs so developers can focus on building their unique business logic.

## Product Vision

Create a lean, production-ready foundation that includes only the essentials every SaaS needs, with clear extension points for custom business logic.

## Core Principle

**Provide the minimum viable foundation, done extremely well, that 90% of SaaS applications need on day 1.**

## Target Use Cases

1. **Startup MVPs** - Launch faster by skipping infrastructure setup
2. **Side Projects** - Focus on business logic, not boilerplate
3. **Enterprise Internal Tools** - Standardized, secure foundation
4. **Agency Projects** - Consistent starting point for client work

## Essential Foundation Components

### 1. Authentication & Authorization (Core)

**User Authentication:**
- User registration with email verification
- Login/logout with JWT tokens (HTTP-only cookies)
- Password reset via email
- Session management with refresh tokens

**Authorization:**
- Role-based access control (user, admin)
- Protected route middleware
- API endpoint protection

### 2. User Management (Core)

**User Routes:**
- `/home` - Simple dashboard (welcome message, navigation)
- `/settings` - Profile management (name, email, password, preferences)

**Admin Routes:**
- `/admin` - User management interface (list, view, deactivate users)

**User Operations:**
- Profile CRUD operations
- Account deletion/deactivation
- Basic user preferences (theme, notifications)

### 3. Infrastructure Essentials (Core)

**Database:**
- GORM migrations and seeding
- User and session models
- Clean repository patterns

**Communication:**
- Email service integration (registration, password reset)
- Template-based email system

**Monitoring:**
- Health check endpoints
- Structured logging
- Error handling patterns

**Security:**
- Password hashing (bcrypt)
- CSRF protection
- Security headers
- Rate limiting on auth endpoints



**Project Structure:**
- Clean domain/service/transport architecture
- Clear separation of concerns
- Consistent patterns across modules

**Development Tools:**
- Hot reload for frontend and backend
- Linting and formatting
- Environment configuration
- Docker development setup

**Documentation:**
- Clear setup instructions
- Extension guidelines
- API documentation structure

## What's Intentionally Excluded

**Business Logic:**
- No specific CRUD examples (tasks, posts, etc.)
- No sample business domains
- No complex workflows

**Advanced Features:**
- No billing/subscription management
- No advanced analytics
- No real-time features
- No multi-tenancy (unless trivial)
- No complex admin dashboards

**Third-party Integrations:**
- No payment processors
- No external analytics
- No social media integrations

## Extension Points

### Clean Architecture
- Domain layer for business logic
- Service layer for business rules
- Transport layer for HTTP/API
- Repository layer for data access

### Modularity
- Feature modules follow consistent patterns
- New modules can be added without touching existing code
- Environment-based feature toggling

### API Design
- RESTful conventions
- Consistent error responses
- Versioning strategy
- OpenAPI documentation structure

## Technical Architecture

### Backend Structure
```
internal/
â”œâ”€â”€ auth/           # Authentication & authorization
â”œâ”€â”€ user/           # User management
â”œâ”€â”€ email/          # Email service
â”œâ”€â”€ admin/          # Admin functionality
â”œâ”€â”€ middleware/     # HTTP middleware
â””â”€â”€ shared/         # Shared utilities
```

### Frontend Structure

```

â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ auth/       # Login, register forms
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layout/     # Headers, navigation
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ui/         # Reusable components
â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Home.tsx    # User dashboard
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Settings.tsx # User settings

- **Security implementation**: 3-5 days saved

**Total time saved: 3-4 weeks of development time**

## Implementation Philosophy

1. **Essential only**: If 90% of SaaS apps don't need it, don't include it
2. **Extension-friendly**: Clear patterns for adding business logic
3. **Production-ready**: Security, monitoring, and deployment included
4. **Developer-focused**: Optimize for developer productivity and clarity
5. **Opinionated but flexible**: Strong conventions with escape hatches

This foundation provides everything needed to start building a SaaS product immediately, without the overhead of complex features that may not be needed.
